Solar Tracking and Autonomous Bus microcontroller code files. The project will allow a mock satellite to:

- track a light source in one dimension using a stepper motor and LED's.
- measure the temperature using two seperate thermistors.
- measure bus battery voltage.
- measure bus battery current.
- transmit telemetry to ground station.

## Updates:

### 2017-04-10

- Added "main.c" to repository.
- "main.c" contains functions for one-way serial communication and basic stepper motor control (one directional movement only).
